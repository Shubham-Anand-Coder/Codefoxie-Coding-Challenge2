*
Assumptions:
1. the no. of containers present in the truck is equal to the no. of vareities of beers given.
2. no. of seconds to complete the journey will be given
3. the temperature reading of each container will be provided at each second of the journey.
4. Inputs:
n -> no. of varieties of beers
range[n] -> range of suitable temperature for different varieties of beer
q -> no. of seconds truck tarvels from start to destination
X -> an array denoting the reading of temperature sensors of each container at each second.
5.Output :
A warning is generated at each second for specific containers if their temperature goes out of the suitable range of the beer.
